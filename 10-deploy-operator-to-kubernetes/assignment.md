    Now that you have a complete operator, it is time to deploy it to Kubernetes!

    While `make run` gives a fast feedback look for development, eventually you will need to deploy your operator to a cluster.

    In this section you will:
    * Build a docker image for your operator
    * Load the docker image into your cluster
    * Generate an operator distribution
    * Deploy the operator distribution into your cluster
