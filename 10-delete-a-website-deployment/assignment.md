teaser: Drift between operator expectations and cluster reality does not always mean
  update. You must also detect and execute on a deletion of existing websites.

    Create Read Update and Delete (CRUD) is considered basic functionality for most applciations and an operator is no different.

    So far you have created a deployment and service, but have yet to read, update or delete.

    **In this challenge you will:**
    * Detect the deletion of a website
    * Delete any resources the operator creates when it's CRD is deleted

üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why delete is an interesting use case
==============

Now your operator can create new resources, and is ready to deal with updates as well. The last major CRUD functionality is to deal with delete requests.

In order to handle deletes, you will need to first identify that the website resource is requesting a delete, and then read the state of the cluster to reconcile any necessary actions in order to complete that delete.


üßëüèΩ‚Äçüéì Learning when a resource should be deleted
==============

The process for identifying deletes is not too different from what you did to detect updates.

Once again, there is a specific error which is raised when the Website custom resource is deleted. You will want to catch this error and then add logic to complete the delete process.

Start by running your operator in the `Run Shell` tab using:
```
make run
```

Then delete your current website resource by running the following command in the `K8s Shell` tab:
```
kubectl delete websites.kubecon.my.domain website-sample
```

When you do this, the deployment and service are still just fine and can be viewed with the following command:

```
kubectl get all --selector=type=Website
```

And if you return to the `Run Shell` tab you will see a large set of error messages and stack traces in the operator logs. Something similar to:

```
ERROR   Reconciler error        {"controller": "website", ... "error": "Website.kubecon.my.domain \"website-sample\" not found"}
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/...
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/...
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/...
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/...
```

> üí° This error may be repeated many times as the reconcile loop will continue to try and reconcile after failures.

In specific, you can see the `error` is stated as `"Website.kubecon.my.domain \"website-sample\" not found"` which means you now know that the error type `not found` indicates when the reconcile runs for a deleted resource.

ü´¥üèæ Gracefully catching the delete error
==============

With your new knowledge of a delete error being `not found`, it is time to return to `website_controller.go` in your `Code editor` tab and add a conditional statement into the error block. When you catch the error fetching the custom resource around line 62, you should edit the error block to read:

```
  // Start by declaring the custom resource to be type "Website"
  customResource := &kubeconv1beta1.Website{}

  // Then retrieve from the cluster the resource that triggered this reconciliation.
  // The contents of this resource are then stored into an object used throughout reconciliation.
  err := r.Client.Get(context.Background(), req.NamespacedName, customResource)
  if err != nil {
    if errors.IsNotFound(err) {
      // TODO: handle deletes gracefully
      log.Info(fmt.Sprintf(`Custom resource for website "%s" does not exist`, req.Name))
      return ctrl.Result{}, nil
    } else {
      log.Error(err, fmt.Sprintf(`Failed to retrieve custom resource "%s"`, req.Name))
      return ctrl.Result{}, err
    }
  }
```

**üíæ Once this change is complete. Remember to save the file which with `ctrl+s`.**

Now make sure to restart the operator in your `Run Shell` tab using `ctrl+c` to cancel the previous run and `make run` to restart it.

With the new version of your code running, test your change by adding a new Website resource and promptly deleting it from your `K8s Shell` tab:

```
kubectl apply --filename ./config/samples/kubecon_v1beta1_website-with-image-tag.yaml
```

This first command will trigger the update message since you are creating a resource by the same name as before.

But next you need to delete that resource:
```
kubectl delete website.kubecon.my.domain website-sample
```

And when you return to the operator logs now you should see a log line instead of noisy error stack traces.


üî• Deleting from Kubernetes to match requested state
==============

Catching the desire to delete is not enough. You must also complete the reconciliation by actually deleting any previously created resource.

In this case that will be the deployment and the service. Find these using the same constructors.

> üí° In more complex scenarios you will likely use labels or annotations to create a more robust clean up strategy, but for this scale operator, name will do just fine!


To complete the deletes, replace the code inside the new error catch block `if errors.IsNotFound(err) {` with the following code:

```
  // If the resource is not found, that is OK. It just means the desired state is to
  // not have any resources for this Website, so we will need to delete them.
  log.Info(fmt.Sprintf(`Custom resource for website "%s" does not exist, deleting associated resources`, req.Name))

  // Now, try and delete the resource, catch any errors
  deployErr := r.Client.Delete(ctx, newDeployment(req.Name, req.Namespace, "n/a"))

  // Success for this delete is either:
  // 1. the delete is successful without error
  // 2. the resource already doesn't exist so delete can't take action
  if deployErr != nil && !errors.IsNotFound(deployErr) {
    // If any other error occurs, log it
    log.Error(deployErr, fmt.Sprintf(`Failed to delete deployment "%s"`, req.Name))
  }

  // repeat logic from the deployment delete
  serviceErr := r.Client.Delete(ctx, newService(req.Name, req.Namespace))
  if serviceErr != nil && !errors.IsNotFound(serviceErr) {
    log.Error(serviceErr, fmt.Sprintf(`Failed to delete service "%s"`, req.Name))
  }

  // If either the deploy or service deletes fail, the reconcile should fail
  if deployErr != nil || serviceErr != nil {
    return ctrl.Result{}, fmt.Errorf("%v/n%v", deployErr, serviceErr)
  }
  return ctrl.Result{}, nil
```

**üíæ Once this change is complete. Remember to save the file which with `ctrl+s`.**

üí™üèø Seeing your deletes in action
==============

Now exercise your operator in any way you would like, but in particular you should try and create and delete website resources to see the operator clean up after itself with your new code.


üìï Summary
==============

Congratulations! You have now not only identified how to detect a delete, but actually written a basic delete implementation.

While many of these implementations are not robust enough for heavy production use, you are well on your way to being able to create an operator with real value to your team.

If you still have time, continue to the next two challenges for deployment and testing.
