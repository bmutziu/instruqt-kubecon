‚úÖ Some new setup has been completed
==============

Since you finished the last challenge, a change has been made to your controller.

Navigate to `controllers/website_controller.go` in your `Code editor` tab and scroll all the way to the bottom. Here you should find a new function called `createDeployment`.

This function encapsulates the necessary Golang code to create a customized deployment for your website.

However, you still need to call this function in the Reconcile loop.

‚úçüèæ Creating a deployment in the reconcile loop
==============

To use the newly available `createDeployment` function, you need to:

1. Call the method from on the `WebReconciler` object
1. Provide both the context (`ctx`) and triggering resource (`customResource`) as parameters
1. Catch and then handle the error return value

The below snippet does all of these things and can be added directly under the log line in your reconcile loop:
```
  // Attempt to create the deployment and return error if it fails
  err = r.Client.Create(ctx, newDeployment(customResource.Name, customResource.Namespace, customResource.Spec.ImageTag))
  if err != nil {
    log.Error(err, fmt.Sprintf(`Failed to create deployment for website "%s"`, customResource.Name))
    return ctrl.Result{}, err
  }
```

üßû Creating a deployment for your current website
==============

Since you created a Website resource earlier, this should still be in your cluster.

Confirm this by running the following command in the `K8s Shell` tab:
```
kubectl get websites.kubecon.my.domain
```

With this already in your cluster, when you start up your controller again it will reconcile immediately. During reconciliation the controller will try to create a deployment as you have defined.

To see this, go to the `Run Shell` tab and start the controller again with:
```
make run
```

You should see the same log lines as before including a hello to your resource.

Once you see this log go back to the `K8s Shell` tab and check for deployments with:
```
kubectl get deployments
```

You should now see a single deployment with 2 replicas starting.

To see more details, you can run:

```
kubectl describe deployment
```

In particular you can see the parts that your code configures including number of `Replicas` and `Labels`.

üß® But what happens on update?
==============

While creating a deployment is an exciting and real world use case for your controller, what happens if it is updated?

You can test this by just stopping and restarting your controller. To stop you controller go to the `Run Shell` tab and use `ctrl+c`. Then restart with the same `make run` command you used before.

You will see the log line but then an error trace something like:

```
ERROR   Failed to create deployment     {"controller": "website", ... "error": "deployments.apps \"website-sample\" already exists"}
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).Reconcile
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:121
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).reconcileHandler
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:320
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).processNextWorkItem
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:273
sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/internal/controller.(*Controller).Start.func2.2
        /root/go/pkg/mod/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.12.2/pkg/internal/controller/controller.go:234
```

That is because the code asks to create a deployment, but there already is one in the cluster. Continue on to see how to deal with this issue.


üìï Summary
==============

In this challenge you added a more realistic use case for your controller by asking it to deploy a website for you.

But this quickly resulted in more work to be done to handle when a deployment already exists. Don't worry, that is coming up next!
